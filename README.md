[Proposal] CrediMint: A Decentralized Reputation & Credential Verification Agent

Introduction

Verifying credentials—such as certifications, work history, and DAO contributions—remains a challenge in Web3. Many claims are forged, unverifiable, or easily lost, making it difficult for DAOs, Web3 projects, and AI-driven hiring platforms to identify real, skilled individuals.

CrediMint is a decentralized credential verification agent that leverages Autonomys Network to store and verify credentials permanently, ensuring trust, transparency, and censorship resistance in reputation-building.


Problem Statement

🛑 Fake credentials are widespread, leading to trust issues in Web3 hiring.

🛑 No unified, decentralized reputation system exists to verify real contributions.

🛑 AI-generated fake identities are rising, making human verification crucial.

🛑 Centralized credential platforms can censor or remove user data arbitrarily.


Solution: CrediMint

CrediMint offers a trustless, on-chain solution for verifying credentials, work history, and reputation scores.

🔹 On-Chain Credential Storage → Certifications, DAO contributions, and work history are permanently stored on Autonomys for verifiability.
🔹 Auto ID Integration → Ensures only real humans can verify and claim credentials.
🔹 Decentralized Endorsements & Challenges → Similar to Argu-mint, verified users can endorse or dispute credentials, creating a trustless validation system.
🔹 Reputation Score Mechanism → Generates a decentralized reputation profile based on verified credentials and community endorsements.


Use Cases

✔️ DAOs & Web3 Projects → Hire contributors based on verified credentials rather than unverifiable claims.
✔️ Freelance Marketplaces → Ensures real experience validation for developers, designers, and Web3 professionals.
✔️ Education & Certifications → Institutions can issue permanent, tamper-proof credentials on-chain.
✔️ AI Hiring Platforms → Provides a human-proof verification system to prevent AI-generated fake applicants.


Why Autonomys?

CrediMint is built for AI3.0 and Web3, making Autonomys the ideal infrastructure:
✅ Hyper-Scalable Storage → Ensures credentials are immutable and permanently available.
✅ Auto ID Integration → Prevents identity fraud and AI-generated fake profiles.
✅ Decentralized Reputation Validation → Uses Argu-mint-style debate mechanisms for community-validated credibility.


Technical Overview

🛠 CrediMint Smart Contract → Stores hashed credentials linked to on-chain verified issuers.
🛠 Auto ID Verification → Ensures credential owners are real humans.
🛠 Argu-mint Validation Module → Allows peer review, endorsements, and disputes.
🛠 API Integrations → Designed for DAOs, Web3 job platforms, and education institutions.

Next Steps

1️⃣ Prototype Development → Build a proof-of-concept using Autonomys SDK.
2️⃣ Community Feedback → Share the idea in the Autonomys Forum & X (Twitter).
3️⃣ Integration & Partnerships → Engage with DAOs, hiring platforms, and education providers.
